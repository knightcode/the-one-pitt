/**
 * This class overrides ActiveRouter in order to inject calls to a 
 * DecisionEngine object where needed add extract as much code from the update()
 * method as possible. 
 * 
 * <strong>Forwarding Logic:</strong> 
 * 
 * A DecisionEngineRouter maintains a List of Tuple<Message, Connection> in 
 * support of a call to ActiveRouter.tryMessagesForConnected() in 
 * DecisionEngineRouter.update(). Since update() is called so frequently, we'd 
 * like as little computation done in it as possible; hence the List that gets
 * updated when events happen. Four events cause the List to be updated: a new 
 * message from this host, a new received message, a connection goes up, or a 
 * connection goes down. On a new message (either from this host or received 
 * from a peer), the collection of open connections is examined to see if the
 * message should be forwarded along them. If so, a new Tuple is added to the
 * List. When a connection goes up, the collection of messages is examined to 
 * determine to determine if any should be sent to this new peer, adding a Tuple
 * to the list if so. When a connection goes down, any Tuple in the list
 * associated with that connection is removed from the List.
 * 
 * <strong>Decision Engines</strong>
 * 
 * Most (if not all) routing decision making is provided by a 
 * RoutingDecisionEngine object. The DecisionEngine Interface defines methods 
 * that enact computation and return decisions as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In createNewMessage(), a call to RoutingDecisionEngine.newMessage() is 
 * 	 made. A return value of true indicates that the message should be added to
 * 	 the message store for routing. A false value indicates the message should
 *   be discarded.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>changedConnection() indicates either a connection went up or down. The
 *   appropriate connectionUp() or connectionDown() method is called on the
 *   RoutingDecisionEngine object. Also, on connection up events, this first
 *   peer to call changedConnection() will also call
 *   RoutingDecisionEngine.doExchangeForNewConnection() so that the two 
 *   decision engine objects can simultaneously exchange information and update 
 *   their routing tables (without fear of this method being called a second
 *   time).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>Starting a Message transfer, a protocol first asks the neighboring peer
 *   if it's okay to send the Message. If the peer indicates that the Message is
 *   OLD or DELIVERED, call to RoutingDecisionEngine.shouldDeleteOldMessage() is
 *   made to determine if the Message should be removed from the message store.
 *   <em>Note: if tombstones are enabled or deleteDelivered is disabled, the 
 *   Message will be deleted and no call to this method will be made.</em>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>When a message is received (in messageTransferred), a call to 
 *   RoutingDecisionEngine.isFinalDest() to determine if the receiving (this) 
 *   host is an intended recipient of the Message. Next, a call to 
 *   RoutingDecisionEngine.shouldSaveReceivedMessage() is made to determine if
 *   the new message should be stored and attempts to forward it on should be
 *   made. If so, the set of Connections is examined for transfer opportunities
 *   as described above.
 *   </li>
 *   <li> When a message is sent (in transferDone()), a call to 
 *   RoutingDecisionEngine.shouldDeleteSentMessage() is made to ask if the 
 *   departed Message now residing on a peer should be removed from the message
 *   store.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <strong>Tombstones</strong>
 * 
 * The ONE has the the deleteDelivered option that lets a host delete a message
 * if it comes in contact with the message's destination. More aggressive 
 * approach lets a host remember that a given message was already delivered by
 * storing the message ID in a list of delivered messages (which is called the
 * tombstone list here). Whenever any node tries to send a message to a host 
 * that has a tombstone for the message, the sending node receives the 
 * tombstone.
